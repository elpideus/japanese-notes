It consists of <font color="#00b050">46 letters</font> and represents Japanese sounds. It is mostly used for grammatical purposes, such as particles and conjugations. It is a good start for learning Japanese, since any [[Kanji]] can be written and read as hiragana (basically splitting it up).

Hiragana is the most important foundation to get to know. Learning hiragana means learning the basics of Japanese pronunciation. Also most books require hiragana knowledge. 

## Hiragana Columns
We can divide hiragana characters in 10 columns plus ん.

### <font color="#0070c0">あいうえお</font> - These are the most important hiragana characters
All the other hiragana characters are basically made out of one of these 5 characters with a consonant attached to them.
### <font color="#0070c0">かきくけこ</font> - These are all the hiragana characters containing "K"
There are no exceptions. It's just the main 5 hiragana characters with a k before them. 
So this row can be written in romaji as **ka**-**ki**-**ku**-**ke**-**ko**.
### <font color="#0070c0">さしすせそ</font> - Just like before but with "S"
There is an exception in し. It is not pronounced "si" (as one would normally expect), but as "shi" ("spelling: she"). So it is written in romaji as **sa**-**shi**-**su**-**se**-**so**.
### <font color="#0070c0">たちつてと</font> - "T" related hiragana characters are kinda confusing
ち is equivalent to "chi" in romaji while つ it's "tsu". Everything else follows the main rules.
