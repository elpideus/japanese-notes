Japanese consists of three scripts: <font color="#0070c0">[[Hiragana]]</font>, <font color="#d99694">Katakana</font> and <font color="#00b050">[[Kanji]]</font>. They can be seen together in a single sentence.

> <font color="#00b050">私</font> <font color="#0070c0">は </font><font color="#d99694">アメリカ</font><font color="#00b050">人</font> <font color="#0070c0">です</font> (I’m American)。

Since there are no spaces between words in Japanese the variation between kanji and hiragana can also be used to increase readability. 
Katakana is mostly used for foreign adopted words or name (mostly the latter).
